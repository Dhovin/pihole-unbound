    # quicker to resolve as the functions related to TCP checks are not done.

    # due to their size.
    do-tcp: yes

    # fragment memory usage.

    rrset-cache-slabs: 8
    infra-cache-slabs: 8
    key-cache-slabs: 8

    # Increase the memory size of the cache. Use roughly twice as much rrset cache
    # memory as you use msg cache memory. Due to malloc overhead, the total memory
    # usage is likely to rise to double (or 2.5x) the total cache memory. A plain number in bytes,
    # append 'k', 'm' or 'g' for kilobytes, megabytes or gigabytes (1024*1024 bytes in a megabyte).
    # Default is 4 megabytes

    # If nonzero, unwanted replies are not only reported in statistics, but also 
    # a running total is kept per thread. If it reaches the threshold, a warning 
    # is printed and a defensive action is taken, the cache is cleared to flush 
    # potential poison out of it.  A suggested value is 10000000, the default is 
    # 0 (turned off). We think 10K is a good value.

    # If you have an internal or private DNS names the external DNS servers can 
    # not resolve, then you can assign domain name strings to be redirected to a 
    # seperate dns server. For example, our comapny has the domain 
    # organization.com and the domain name internal.organization.com can not be 
    # resolved by Google's public DNS, but can be resolved by our private DNS 
    # server located at 1.1.1.1. The following tells Unbound that any 
    # organization.com domain, i.e. *.organization.com, can be dns resolved by 1.1.1.1 
    # instead of the public dns servers.

    #    name: "organization.com"
